### WP Theme Boilerplate

This is a starter theme for working in Wordpress projects.

#### Getting Started
* Download or clone this theme and place it on your `wp-content/themes` folder
* Run `npm install & bower install` on that folder
* I strongly recommend you to create a proxy on your /etc/hosts file for working on a website
* After that, place your website domain in `gulpfile.js#49`, e.g: http://mywebsite.dev
* Run `gulp` in theme folder and start the development
